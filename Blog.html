                 <cite><b>My Business Ideas</b><i> By Rahul Singh</i></cite><br/>
                 In my coursework I intend to start my own business. I will devise my 
                 own business plan which outlines my business proposal and the key 
                aspects, during this I will need to seek good business advice on the 
                necessary steps I will have to make. As I go through the coursework I 
               will show evidence, examples and explain how businesses are set up, 
               what types of businesses there are and their similarities, the kind of 
               targets businesses set for themselves and also the different 
                 objectives of different stakeholders. For my business I plan to sell 
                 toys and other game products that educate young children under the age 
            of 11. 
            <br/><br/>
             Starting up a business is difficult and risky. Anyone setting up needs 
            to consider: 
            <ul>
                <li> Whether they have the right experience and skills to make the 
                        business a success. </li>

                <li>How they are going to produce and market their product or service. 
                      </li>

                <li>How they can get help and advice that is available to them from 
                  outside the business. </li>

                  <li>What will happen if the business is not a success? </li>      
            </ul><br/>
           
            Identifying the opportunity 
            <br/>
            Identifying a business opportunity is the first thing a person wanting 
            to set up his or hers own business must do. The business opportunity 
            is most likely to come from what they are already doing in work and 
            the contacts they have. People with no experience are more likely to 
            find it difficult to set up a business and make it a success. This is 
            the reason why most people who set up their own business have already 
             had experience of working in an industry. They then have to find out 
            whether the idea will work. 
            <br/>
            Researching the market 
            <br/>
            Businesses only survive if they can attract customers and at least 
            make enough money to cover their costs. So it is important to find out 
            whether there are likely to be enough customers. There are two ways of 
            researching the market. 

            <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
                <li>Desk Research – involves finding existing information about the 
                    market. For example, a person wanting to set up a beauty salon 
                     would look in the Yellow Pages to find the locations of other 
                    salons in the area in order to assess the likely competition. </li>

                 <li>
                     Field Research – involves finding information that is not 
                     available in books etc. 
                 </li>   
            </ul>

                 <cite><b>Start a small Business</b><i> By Dia Khan</i></cite><br/>
                  Small businesses benefit both the economy, by creating new jobs and industries, and consumers, by providing innovative specialized goods and services to fill specialized market niches. Over 90 percent of businesses are considered small businesses, which create vast new industries, encourage entrepreneurship, and revitalize economically depressed areas by creating many new jobs in the local area. The individuals owning and operating a small business can benefit greatly as well, through careful planning and proper management.<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small businesses create the largest portion of new jobs in the country. In fact, 99.7% of all employers are small businesses. (sba.gov/aboutsba/sbastats.html) Members of the workforce that have a lower chance of finding a job, such as women, minorities, and welfare recipients, find employment easier in small businesses. Low-income areas can attract small businesses due to the lower cost of operation, and can grow economically as a result of the new jobs, improving the quality of life of the area. Together, these uplifted areas contribute to the national economy. Small businesses generate 47 percent of the nation's sales and over half of the GDP. The three ways that a small business can form are sole proprietorships, partnerships, and corporations.<br/>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most small businesses are sole proprietorships. The individual owner gains unlimited control and flexibility over the business, as well as all the profits, but also gains unlimited financial liability and financing limitations. Sole proprietorships are most commonly small or temporary businesses, due to the limited finances and ease of formation and dissolution. However, the owner must take on all managerial and operational tasks, which can lead to disaster if the owner lacks sufficient knowledge and training in the areas key to a business's success.<br/>
             Another type of small business organization is the partnership. Partnerships benefit from the combine...
